Execute as normal user, dont get root mode and execute it or will give error,
Example: normaluser@user


This only help for keep deleted zsh_history in root and normal user (you are logged in) and not history is saved of all commands you execute on your terminal
for see Changes work after executing script restart terminal (close and open a new terminal) and you will see no more zsh_history :)
